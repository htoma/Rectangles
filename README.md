# Rectangles
Intersecting rectangles:

Given two rectangles specified by their (Top, Left) and (Width, Height) it computes the intersection, if any, of the same type.
The inspiration source was https://www.interviewcake.com/question/java/rectangular-love

I'm using an FsCheck data generator to produce a collection of rectangles that I intersect, draw into images and create an animated gif of the result. Intersected rectangle has the same color as the background.

Run.fsx for playing with.
